                <p class="who-p" >Generally, cheetahs have a more slender build as they chase and kill their prey. Being the fastest land animal on earth, the cheetah needs to have a slender build to be streamlined and more efficient at running. A leopard, on the other hand, has a more muscular build. They ambush predators, meaning they stalk their prey and pounce on them when they are within attacking range. The tail of the cheetah is quite flat, and it acts as a rudder on an aeroplane. They help in cornering and changing directions at speeds of over 80 km/h. The Leopard's tail is more stocky and tubular. It acts like a counterweight and helps the animal climb trees and to drag their kill up a tree. The other obvious difference is in their coats. Cheetahs have clear black spots all over its body and a leopard has irregular, rose-shaped spots called rosettes on its body. Cheetahs have black, tear-like streaks that run from the corner of their eyes all the way down to their cheeks. These are theorized to help absorb blinding sunlight and reduce glare in the intense heat of Saharan Africa. These spots are completely absent on the leopard's face. Compared to Cheetahs, Leopards are very good tree climbers, as they can easily climb up with the help of their retractile claws while cheetahs cannot.</p>

                <p class="who-p" >Nature experts and novices alike would be forgiven for confusing these two stocky, horned animals. While they might be similar in many ways, there are several distinct differences between black and white rhinos, including their appearance, habitats, and behaviour. Their physical appearance is probably the most striking similarity between these two members of the Rhinocerotidae family. However, they differ quite dramatically in size. Black rhino generally weigh between 900 - 1.350 kg, while the size of their counterpart is almost double at 1.800 - 2.500 kg. White rhino are  the second-largest land mammal after the elephant. Other than size, another noteworthy difference in appearance is their upper lip. The white rhino's name, in fact, has nothing to do with its colour. The name is derived from the Afrikaans word “weit”, which means wide, and refers to the animal's muzzle. Black rhinos, on the other hand, have more of a hooked lip. Another distinct difference between these two horned creatures is their face shape and size. Black rhino have a shorter head from forehead to mouth, but a more protruding and smaller head. White rhino have a longer, less defined forehead and a much longer skull. Black rhino also tend to carry their heads higher, while white rhino lower their heads closer to the ground making grazing easier. Black rhino also have smaller, rounder ears than white rhino, whose ears are more pointed and narrower at the top. The larger size of white rhinos' ears is an important evolutionary adaptation for them as they make up for their poor eyesight with a nose that's usually close to the ground. Although the black and white rhino both have two horns, the size and shape differ. The horns of black rhino are closer in length to one another, while the front horn of white rhino is longer than the second. Horns of male and female black rhino differ in that males often have thicker horns and females have longer, thinner ones. As mentioned above, black rhino have a hooked lip and white rhino are known as square-lipped rhinos. This is due to their different eating habits. Black rhino browse instead of graze, so their hooked lip helps them to grab leaves from trees. In comparison, white rhino graze on grass, walking with their square-lipped heads close to the ground.</p>
