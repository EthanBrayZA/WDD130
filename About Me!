<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Ethan Bray</h2>
<p>Hello everyone! As you can see above, my name is Ethan.
I am from Roodepoort in the city of Johannesburg in South Africa and I am 21 years old. I have always had a fascination for technology. Especially the programming side of it. I love Hiking, playing sports, playing video games,
and spending time with my family. I have been to many Mountains here in South Africa but the most famous and my personal favorite is Table Mountain. I played Rugby for a time until I injured both of my knees in a bad tackle
so I have started playing Squash and I love it! I am the second oldest in my family with two younger sisters and an older brother. I have just recently returned from serving a mission in South Africa Cape Town, and the above 
image is a picture of me with my cousin who was born while I was serving.</p>
<p>I really look forward knowing all of you and learning from you.</p>
